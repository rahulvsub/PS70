### 2D Design

This week comprised an introduction to CAD software through 2D design, with an eye to fabricating these designs through laser and vinyl cutting. While I've tinkered with a few different CAD programs in the past, including Autodesk Inventor and Tinkercad, I've always learned them in a somewhat ad hoc manner and have never been completely satisfied with any program thus far. I was therefore excited to have an opportunity to learn Fusion 360, which I had heard from others to be a highly approachable yet capable 2D/3D CAD program. After the class lectures, I started to design my press-fit construction kit in Fusion 360 during the lab period. I wanted to choose a shape that could tesselate since I felt this would create more interesting and neat structures, so I decided to make my kit pieces hexagon-shaped. I created a table of parameters first to make the design as modifiable as possible, with parameters for the side length of a hexagon and the width/depth of a slot for the pieces to interlock with each other. I also included a kerf parameter to account for the material removed during cutting, knowing full well that I'd likely have to change it (and maybe several times). I then created parameters for actual physical dimensions that account for kerf, which I used to dimension the hexagon design and slots.

A first trip to the laser cutter showed that the design works, but the kerf is a little larger than anticipated, likely because I had to make two passes with the laser on each shape to ensure it was fully cut:

Increasing the kerf parameter from 0.5mm to 1mm got rid of the extra space, and now the pieces fit together nicely:

It occurred to me that two pieces interlocked with each other resembled a snowflake, so I decided to print pieces of varying sizes to make a large snowflake that I could use as a winter-themed decoration in my room. By changing the side_length parameter, I was able to rapidly create designs with side lengths of 20mm, 40mm and 60mm, and cut them all at once. Here's an image of a snowflake in progress, with the largest (60mm) piece in the middle, 6x medium (40mm) pieces attached around it, and 6x smallest (20mm) pieces on the left waiting to be attached:

I also considered cutting white vinyl covers to stick on each piece so it looks more like a (white) snowflake, but decided against this since it would require a large amount of vinyl to cover all the pieces (12 faces for the small pieces, 12 faces for the medium pieces and 2 faces for the large piece).

### 3D Design Tutorials

In order to get more familiar with Fusion 360, I completed some of Autodesk's provided online tutorials (found [here](https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/courses/#fusion-360-fundamentals "Fusion 360 Tutorials")) for important features and operations in Fusion 360. First, I watched a series of videos about making and constraining sketches so that they are fully defined and constrained, and made this profile of a GoPro camera:

I then watched some videos about how to extrude sketches into 3D objects. I was particularly surprised by the power and range of capabilities of the Extrude tool, especially how it could make thin walls and cutouts in 3D objects. I made this wheel with axle cutout using only a sketch and the Extrude tool:

The best way to get better at CAD is of course to practice it, so I modeled a couple basic objects by measuring them with calipers and modeling them as best I could in Fusion 360.

I made a pencil:

and a pencil cup:

and imported a table from online:
