### Final Project Ideas

I particularly enjoy making functional objects; that is, useful objects that perform necessary or helpful functions in my daily life. However, I also like to infuse the things I make with some quirky design and a healthy dose of off-the-rails or absurdist humor. That being said, here are some ideas for a final project for this class:

* I currently use a (very) audible alarm on my smartphone to wake up in the mornings so I can get to class on time. However, I've come to despise sound-based alarms, as they usually jolt me awake regardless of what stage of sleep I'm in. If I'm in the middle of a dream when I get awakened by my alarm, then chances are I'll feel off and slightly dazed for the rest of the day. To avoid this, I'd like to design some sort of alternative alarm clock which senses my brain waves (something that commercial [technologies](https://choosemuse.com/ "Muse Headband") [already](https://www.emotiv.com/ "Emotiv Headband") [do](https://store.neurosky.com/ "NeuroSky Products")) and wakes me up gently when I'm already at the end of a sleep cycle. Perhaps a robotic arm to nudge me awake?

* I have a coffee table in my common room, but moving it out of the way can get annoying. I'd like to make a coffee table which looks like an ordinary coffee table but can walk itself out of the way, a la Boston Dynamics robots. The table legs, then, would really be legs!
